OmniCore is a **multi-system Android emulation hub**. Each console owns its runtime, settings, storage, input policy and performance logic while sharing one Android library experience.

<!-- OMNICORE_PUBLIC_STATUS_START -->
## Current status

| Channel | Version | Status |
|---|---:|---|
| Stable DEV | **0.9.4** | PS1 gameplay, video, audio and controls device validated |
| N64 maintenance | **0.10.23 Alpha 24** | Gameplay baseline protected; startup-only audio polish remains non-blocking |
| PS2 device-test | **0.11.4 Alpha 5** | Corrective build published and CI validated; physical-device retest in progress |

### Latest milestone — PS2 Alpha 5 corrective build

**OmniCore 0.11.4 PS2 Alpha 5** is the current PlayStation 2 device-test build. The latest corrective pass keeps the Alpha 5 version/tag while addressing physical-device feedback without moving to Alpha 6.

The PS2 track currently provides:

- isolated Android process: `com.omnicore.emulator:ps2`;
- pinned Play! backend revision `04bde0df87ee7c0e2f0151b51bb2cc22c88541da`;
- dedicated `PS2Backend` boundary between OmniCore and Play!;
- real Play! VM lifecycle, Android `Surface` rendering and content-URI disk boot;
- Play! `GameConfig.xml` compatibility database pinned and packaged;
- ARM64 + ARMv7 Play! builds with full LTO;
- real frame/draw-call telemetry JNI;
- Android frame-rate pacing and sustained-performance support where available;
- PS2 touch/controller layer, save-state UX and per-system settings isolation;
- user-owned PS2 BIOS picker/storage validation groundwork while the current Play! runtime still uses HLE BIOS;
- stable OmniCore DEV signer and native/APK 16 KB page-size compatibility validation.

### Alpha 5 corrective pass

The latest Alpha 5 rebuild specifically addresses three physical-device issues reported during testing:

- **renderer fallback black screen:** the previous measured tuning could persist an alternate Vulkan/GLES renderer after sustained low FPS and force it on the next launch. Automatic persistent renderer switching is now disabled, and stale per-game forced renderer state is cleared instead of being reused;
- **PS2 runtime stutter pressure:** memory/thermal telemetry remains available, but expensive device-pressure sampling is cached instead of being refreshed on every short sampler interval, reducing work on the gameplay path;
- **hub/UI scrolling stutter:** the always-running animated starfield behind the main Compose hub was replaced by a lightweight static starfield, reducing continuous drawing/overdraw while keeping the same visual identity.

This corrective build **does not lower the selected PS2 internal resolution, enable cycle skipping or trade away the 1.0× quality floor** to hide performance problems.

### SmartPerf policy for PS2

Optimization is part of the PS2 architecture, not a late-stage add-on. SmartPerf uses measured information only when the backend exposes it, and unknown timing fields remain unknown instead of being guessed.

Alpha 5 keeps the **1.0× minimum quality floor**, keeps cycle skipping disabled, and no longer changes the per-game renderer automatically on a later boot. Renderer changes remain explicit/user-controlled until a safer compatibility-aware policy is proven on hardware.

### Latest validation

GitHub Actions run **32278321118** completed successfully for the corrected PS2 Alpha 5. It passed protected PS1/N64 rebuilds, Alpha 5 source contract validation, Android toolchains, stable DEV signing preparation, pinned Play! + GameConfig fetch, dual-ABI full-LTO build, telemetry JNI validation, signed APK assembly, signer verification, native/APK 16 KB compatibility, GPL source archival and prerelease publication.

Physical-device validation of the corrective build is **in progress**; runtime behavior is not marked solved until the new APK is retested on hardware.

## Runtime isolation

- **PS1** remains on its validated PCSX-ReARMed path.
- **N64** runs in `com.omnicore.emulator:n64` and keeps the protected Alpha 24 gameplay baseline.
- **PS2** runs in `com.omnicore.emulator:ps2`, with its own backend, lifecycle and performance path.

PS2 CI rejects accidental changes to protected PS1/N64 runtime-owned source paths.

## Protected N64 baseline

The N64 maintenance channel preserves:

- Intelligent **1.5×** internal resolution: `960×720` at 4:3 / `960×540` widescreen;
- framebuffer emulation protected;
- Dynarec-first CPU path;
- HLE RSP default;
- PrecisionGovernor v2.1;
- CruiseGuard / MicroBurstShield / NonBlockingTelemetry;
- CadencePolish + DirectPresenter;
- AudioBackend Auto + AudioHealthWatch;
- StartupAudioGate + SmoothAudioResampler + SyncSlew + ElasticAudioBridge + TransitionAudioShield;
- Smart Analog / Kirby profile;
- RacingComfort v2 / Mario Kart 64 profile;
- editable touch-control positions and sizing;
- optional D-pad visibility;
- USB/Bluetooth controller input;
- save RAM and save states;
- StarUI Smooth;
- offline Achievements v2 / Constelação OmniCore.

## Immediate development priorities

1. Complete physical-device retest of the corrected PS2 Alpha 5 build.
2. Verify repeated game launch after sustained slow-motion no longer produces a black screen.
3. Measure remaining PS2 stutter/slow-motion without lowering the requested internal resolution.
4. Verify hub tab/scroll fluidity after removing continuous background animation.
5. Keep PS1/N64 protected while applying only evidence-driven PS2 corrections.
