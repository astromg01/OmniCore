OmniCore is a **multi-system Android emulation hub**. Each console owns its runtime, settings, storage, input policy and performance logic while sharing one Android library experience.

<!-- OMNICORE_PUBLIC_STATUS_START -->
## Current status

| Channel | Version | Status |
|---|---:|---|
| Stable DEV | **0.9.4** | PS1 gameplay, video, audio and controls device validated |
| N64 maintenance | **0.10.23 Alpha 24** | Gameplay baseline protected; startup-only audio polish remains non-blocking |
| PS2 device-test | **0.11.5 Alpha 6** | PCSX2/ARMSX2 foundation and Visibility v1 telemetry validated in CI; physical-device testing is next |

### Latest milestone — PS2 Alpha 6: PCSX2 Foundation

**OmniCore 0.11.5 PS2 Alpha 6** is the current PlayStation 2 device-test build. Alpha 6 replaces the Play! runtime used by Alphas 1–5 with a pinned **PCSX2/ARMSX2 Android ARM64** foundation and moves PS2 optimization toward measured, source-level GS work rather than hidden quality reductions.

The PS2 Alpha 6 track currently provides:

- isolated Android process: `com.omnicore.emulator:ps2`;
- pinned PCSX2/ARMSX2 revision `7f0ae7a6c689b5b36eccc61b7adb480f65c7a3a3`;
- dedicated `PS2Backend` boundary between OmniCore and PCSX2;
- real user-supplied PS2 BIOS requirement — no Sony BIOS is bundled or downloaded;
- Direct Boot through PCSX2 Fast Boot and Classic BIOS boot through real firmware with Fast Boot disabled;
- automatic renderer selection delegated to PCSX2 instead of an OmniCore renderer-forcing loop;
- SmartPerf measurement-only policy: no automatic renderer, limiter or internal-resolution mutation and no cycle skipping;
- protected **1.0× minimum internal-resolution quality floor**;
- source-built ARM64 PCSX2 emucore with 4 KB and 16 KB page-size variants;
- Visibility v1 GS telemetry for primitive culling, draw batches, fog workload and alpha workload;
- BALANCED lockstep measurement path without re-enabling the visually unsafe pipelined path;
- PS2 touch/controller layer, save-state UX and per-system settings isolation;
- stable OmniCore DEV signer and native/APK 16 KB page-size compatibility validation;
- PS1/N64 runtime source paths protected by CI.

### Visibility v1 status

The latest Alpha 6 build keeps visibility work **measurement-first**. CULL, FOG and ALPHA information is collected from the source-built GS path, but OmniCore does not yet discard additional draws based on that telemetry.

The next physical-device pass is intended to measure how much genuinely invisible primitive work exists in real gameplay before any active visibility optimization is enabled. This avoids trading image correctness for synthetic performance gains.

Alpha 6 does **not** lower the requested PS2 internal resolution below 1.0×, enable EE cycle skipping, disable fog, remove alpha effects or use aggressive affinity pinning to manufacture higher FPS.

### Latest CI validation

GitHub Actions run **32401858158** completed successfully for commit `308ea7abf9d1499bcb07622c38d20d54e69387ad` after the Android system-SONAME validation fix.

The successful pipeline validated the pinned PCSX2/ARMSX2 source build, protected PS1/N64 cores, the custom JNI bridge and Visibility v1 symbol, signed release APK assembly, the expected development signer, 16 KB native/APK compatibility and corresponding GPL source artifacts before publishing the Alpha 6 prerelease.

Physical-device validation of this newest Alpha 6 build is **still pending**; runtime performance or visibility gains are not marked solved until they are measured on hardware.

### Public information automation

Public release status is mirrored in `config/public-status.json`. Documentation-only public-status updates use `[skip ci]` to avoid unnecessary build loops.

## Runtime isolation

- **PS1** remains on its validated PCSX-ReARMed path.
- **N64** runs in `com.omnicore.emulator:n64` and keeps the protected Alpha 24 gameplay baseline.
- **PS2** runs in `com.omnicore.emulator:ps2` on the pinned PCSX2/ARMSX2 foundation, with its own backend, lifecycle, settings and performance path.

PS2 CI rejects accidental changes to protected PS1/N64 runtime-owned source paths.

## Protected N64 baseline

The N64 maintenance channel preserves:

- Intelligent **1.5×** internal resolution: `960×720` at 4:3 / `960×540` widescreen;
- framebuffer emulation protected;
- Dynarec-first CPU path;
- HLE RSP default;
- PrecisionGovernor v2.1;
- CruiseGuard / MicroBurstShield / NonBlockingTelemetry;
- CadencePolish + DirectPresenter;
- AudioBackend Auto + AudioHealthWatch;
- StartupAudioGate + SmoothAudioResampler + SyncSlew + ElasticAudioBridge + TransitionAudioShield;
- Smart Analog / Kirby profile;
- RacingComfort v2 / Mario Kart 64 profile;
- editable touch-control positions and sizing;
- optional D-pad visibility;
- USB/Bluetooth controller input;
- save RAM and save states;
- StarUI Smooth;
- offline Achievements v2 / Constelação OmniCore.

## Immediate development priorities

1. Complete physical-device testing of the latest PS2 Alpha 6 PCSX2/ARMSX2 build.
2. Capture Visibility v1 telemetry in a repeatable heavy gameplay scene.
3. Measure CULL, FOG, ALPHA, GS and synchronization behavior before enabling any additional draw rejection.
4. Implement only evidence-backed visibility optimization that preserves visual correctness and the 1.0× quality floor.
5. Keep PS1/N64 protected while applying isolated PS2 changes.
